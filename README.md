Problem & Solution
Most Web3 communication still happens off-chain â€” fragmented across Telegram, Discord, and X, with no wallet-based identity or trust. Solanafon solves this by creating a native, on-chain voice and video communication layer for Solana, enabling token-gated rooms, wallet-verified calls, and direct monetization through Solana transactions. This bridges the gap between blockchain identity and real-time interaction inside the Solana ecosystem.
